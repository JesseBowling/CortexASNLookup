This is an analyzer for [Cortex](https://github.com/CERT-BDF/Cortex/blob/master/README.md). It will do IP address lookups against the Shadowserver BGP-IP Lookup service.

To install, place these files in a new directory (such as "ASNLookup") under your Cortex Analyzers directory.

Note that the requirements file is for Python3, thus you might need to:

<pre>
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
</pre>

Please report any issues or feature requests here!
